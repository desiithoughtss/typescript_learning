// Basics
/* [
=> superset of the js 
=> statically typed compiled langauge 
=> static typing and other features too 
=> static typed, we need to define the types while defining
=> dynamic type, we do not to explicitly mention
=> ts code is compiled in js first
=> js code is directly complied on browser or by runtime env
=>ts, compile time error checking
=> js, error at runtime
=> ts supports betters in oops
=> js basic prototype based oops
=> ts is compiled to the js, this complete process is know as the traspilation (basically the tranpilation is high level to high level but compilation is high to low)
=> this is beacuse the att he end we need to show all the code int he browser so it only understand the js so we need to convert
=> ts code under the hood is converted to the js always, so at the end we always get the js
=> ts has the backward compatibility which is basically the thing that convert the js code to that code which the borwsers understand even the new ES6 features are also converted so that the old browsers can easily understand the code

// Types
/* [
=> any (no type safety which is the main function of the ts), mostly we shoould avoid using the any, but sometimes we can when ts dont know what data is coming from api


] */

// foreach does not return anything
// drwabck of tuple in ts is we can push the value to it
