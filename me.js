// Basics
/* [
=> superset of the js 
=> statically typed compiled langauge 
=> static typing and other features too 
=> static typed, we need to define the types while defining
=> dynamic type, we do not to explicitly mention
=> ts code is compiled in js first
=> js code is directly complied on browser or by runtime env
=>ts, compile time error checking
=> js, error at runtime
=> ts supports betters in oops
=> js basic prototype based oops
=> ts is compiled to the js, this complete process is know as the traspilation (basically the tranpilation is high level to high level but compilation is high to low)
=> this is beacuse the att he end we need to show all the code int he browser so it only understand the js so we need to convert
=> ts code under the hood is converted to the js always, so at the end we always get the js
=> ts has the backward compatibility which is basically the thing that convert the js code to that code which the borwsers understand even the new ES6 features are also converted so that the old browsers can easily understand the code

// Types
/* [
=> any (no type safety which is the main function of the ts), mostly we shoould avoid using the any, but sometimes we can when ts dont know what data is coming from api
=> if we have assigned any value with undefined or null we change them as well
=> typles are used in the ts for the strict positioning of the array
=> drawback of tuple in ts is we can push the value to it


=> enums by default take the value of the index
=> unknow type is when we dont know what could be the value of the type
=> unkown and the any type are almost same but the hing is that we cant use the unknow type before checking it like checking the type of it, we neet check it first only than we can run it or use it 
=> never type, use in the while or error conditions (need to learn more for it )
=> void is used in function we the function need to do some task but it dont need to return anything
